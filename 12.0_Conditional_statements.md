# Conditional Statements in Linux Shell Scripting

Conditional statements allow the execution of different code blocks based on conditions. In shell scripting, `if`, `if-else`, and `elif` statements are commonly used for decision-making.

## 1. `if` Statement
The `if` statement executes a block of code only if a condition is true.

### Example:
```sh
#!/bin/bash
num=10
if [ $num -gt 5 ]; then
    echo "$num is greater than 5"
fi
```

## 2. `if-else` Statement
The `if-else` statement provides an alternative block to execute if the condition is false.

### Example:
```sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num
if [ $num -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "The number is positive."
else
    echo "The number is zero or negative."
fi
```

## 3. `elif` (Else If) Statement
The `elif` statement allows multiple conditions to be checked sequentially.

### Example:
```sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num
if [ $num -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "The number is positive."
elif [ $num -lt 0 ]; then
    echo "The number is negative."
else
    echo "The number is zero."
fi
```

## 4. Using Logical Operators
### Example (AND Operator `-a`):
```sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num
if [ $num -gt 0 -a $num -lt 100 ]; then
    echo "The number is between 1 and 99."
else
    echo "The number is out of range."
fi
```

### Example (OR Operator `-o`):
```sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a letter:"
read letter
if [ "$letter" == "a" -o "$letter" == "A" ]; then
    echo "You entered the letter A."
else
    echo "You entered a different letter."
fi
```

## Conclusion
- `if` statements check a single condition.
- `if-else` adds an alternative execution path.
- `elif` allows multiple conditions to be evaluated.
- Logical operators can combine conditions for more complex decision-making.

Understanding these structures is crucial for writing efficient shell scripts.
