# Executing Commands on Multiple Remote Machines

## Using a Loop

To execute a command on multiple remote servers using a loop:

```sh
for host in server1 server2 server3; do
    ssh user@$host "command"
done
```

### Example:
```sh
for host in 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.101 192.168.1.102; do
    ssh user@$host "uptime"
done
```

## Using a Variable

You can store the list of hosts in a variable:

```sh
HOSTS="192.168.1.100 192.168.1.101 192.168.1.102"
for host in $HOSTS; do
    ssh user@$host "uptime"
done
```

## Using a File

If you have a list of hosts stored in a file, you can read from it:

```sh
while read host; do
    ssh user@$host "uptime"
done < hosts.txt
```

## Using `parallel`

GNU `parallel` allows executing commands on multiple remote hosts simultaneously:

```sh
echo -e "server1\nserver2\nserver3" | parallel -j 3 ssh user@{} "command"
```

### Example:
```sh
echo -e "192.168.1.100\n192.168.1.101\n192.168.1.102" | parallel -j 3 ssh user@{} "df -h"
```

## Using Ansible

Ansible is a powerful tool for managing multiple remote servers:

1. Install Ansible:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install ansible
   ```

2. Create an inventory file (hosts.ini):
   ```ini
   [servers]
   192.168.1.100
   192.168.1.101
   192.168.1.102
   ```

3. Run a command on all servers:
   ```sh
   ansible -i hosts.ini servers -m command -a "uptime"
   ```

## Using `pssh`

`pssh` (Parallel SSH) allows executing commands on multiple hosts in parallel:

1. Install `pssh`:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install pssh
   ```

2. Create a file `hosts.txt`:
   ```
   192.168.1.100
   192.168.1.101
   192.168.1.102
   ```

3. Execute a command:
   ```sh
   pssh -h hosts.txt -l user -i "uptime"
   ```

## Conclusion

These methods allow efficient execution of commands across multiple remote machines. Depending on the use case, you can choose between loops, `parallel`, Ansible, or `pssh` for better automation and scalability.
