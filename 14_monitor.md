# Monitoring Httpd Process Script

This document outlines the steps to automate and monitor the `httpd` process on a Linux-based system using a shell script and `cron`.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure that the system has `httpd` installed and running.
2. You need to have `sudo` privileges to execute the script and start the `httpd` service.

## Steps

### 1. Script Creation

- First, create a shell script that checks the status of the `httpd` process. If the process is not running, the script will attempt to start it.
- Save the script as `14_monitor.sh` in the appropriate directory (e.g., `/home/ec2-user/scripting/`).

### 2. Script Automation with Cron

- Use `cron` to schedule the script to run periodically. To edit the `cron` configuration, run:

  ```bash
  crontab -e
  ```

- Add the following line to run the script every minute:

  ```bash
  * * * * * /home/ec2-user/scripting/14_monitor.sh &>> /var/log/monit_httpd.log
  ```

  This will execute the script every minute, and append both stdout and stderr to the log file `/var/log/monit_httpd.log`.

### 3. Log File

- The scriptâ€™s output, including any errors or successful operations, will be logged in `/var/log/monit_httpd.log`. Make sure the log file exists and the script has write access to it.

### 4. Testing

- Once the cron job is set, check the log file after a minute to confirm the script is running as expected:

  ```bash
  cat /var/log/monit_httpd.log
  ```

- You should see entries indicating whether the `httpd` process was already running or if the script successfully started it.

### 5. Permissions

- Ensure the script file has executable permissions:

  ```bash
  chmod +x /home/ec2-user/scripting/14_monitor.sh
  ```

## Conclusion

This process automates the monitoring and management of the `httpd` process. By scheduling the script to run periodically with `cron`, you can ensure the service is always running and automatically restart it if necessary.
