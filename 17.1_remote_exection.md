# Remote Commands and Shell Script Execution

## Executing Remote Commands via SSH

To execute a command on a remote server via SSH, use the following syntax:

```sh
ssh user@remote_host "command"
```

### Example:
```sh
ssh user@192.168.1.100 "ls -l /var/log"
```

## Executing a Local Script on a Remote Server

You can execute a local script on a remote server using SSH:

```sh
ssh user@remote_host 'bash -s' < script.sh
```

or:

```sh
cat script.sh | ssh user@remote_host 'bash -s'
```

### Example:
```sh
ssh user@192.168.1.100 'bash -s' < myscript.sh
```

## Copying and Executing a Script on a Remote Server

If you need to copy the script to the remote server before execution:

```sh
scp script.sh user@remote_host:/tmp/
ssh user@remote_host 'bash /tmp/script.sh'
```

### Example:
```sh
scp myscript.sh user@192.168.1.100:/tmp/
ssh user@192.168.1.100 'bash /tmp/myscript.sh'
```

## Running a Remote Command as Root

To execute commands as root on the remote server:

```sh
ssh user@remote_host "echo 'password' | sudo -S command"
```

### Example:
```sh
ssh user@192.168.1.100 "echo 'mypassword' | sudo -S apt update"
```

**Note:** Using SSH keys and proper sudo permissions is a more secure approach.

## Running Remote Commands in the Background

To run a remote command in the background:

```sh
ssh user@remote_host "nohup command > output.log 2>&1 &"
```

### Example:
```sh
ssh user@192.168.1.100 "nohup python3 script.py > output.log 2>&1 &"
```

## Using SSH Keys for Password-less Authentication

To avoid entering a password each time, set up SSH keys:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-copy-id user@remote_host
```

After this, you can SSH into the remote host without a password.

## Running Multiple Commands on a Remote Server

```sh
ssh user@remote_host "command1; command2; command3"
```

### Example:
```sh
ssh user@192.168.1.100 "cd /var/www && ls -l && whoami"
```

## Conclusion

Using SSH for remote command execution and script deployment is a powerful way to manage remote servers efficiently. Secure your SSH connections by using key-based authentication and restricting root access.
